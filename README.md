# Axiom-Verge-Music-Mod

Here's a music mod for Axiom Verge that I created for myself that I'd like to share with you. The original soundtrack is excellent, but makes me feel depressed. This changes the entire tone of the soundtrack to have more of an uplifting, heroic feel like that of Blaster Master Zero or Metroid. Uses original music from some extremely talented creators as well as famitracker covers of a song or two from games like Deltarune or the Touhou series.

How to install:
1) Find your Axiom Verge directory. If you're like me and got the game for free on the Epic Games Store, it's located in:
C:\Program Files\Epic Games\AxiomVerge\Content\Audio\Music
But otherwise, search your PC for OuterBeyond9.ogg and you'll find it.

1) Back up your existing Music directory
2) Replace the music with the music in this mod

All credit goes to the original creators of this music (NecrophageonIII, bran, and others)
